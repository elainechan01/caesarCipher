# Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder

This is a Python implementation of a Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder. The program will take in the user's input of a sentence either to be encoded or decoded. The program will then request for a shift value from the user. For each character in the input string, the program will replace the character with a character whose ASCII value is that of the original character after being shifted with the shift value.
